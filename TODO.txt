Wallpaper should be cool
Nvim with all of my plugins and configurations that make sense
Languages: English, Chinese, and Russian.

In this repo, add a secrets directory, and this will have extra users and keys, paths to private files, and like hashed passwords or whatever.
Update README to use default computer
Move computers/default/base.nix to computers/base.nix
Organize system module to have specific Optimizations directory (For laptops, specific CPUs, et cetera.
Add AMD support

Add section in README that explains how to correctly add new part to modules directory
Add README's to all directories to explain exactly what it's for and how to use it. (example: computers. It's for system configs for different computers)
Redo structure to include a common/base config for both users and computers
Get Godot-mono to run (currently c# is limiting it)
