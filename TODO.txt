In this repo, add a secrets directory, and this will have extra users and keys, paths to private files,
and like hashed passwords or whatever.

Things that are too hard for how much time they save configuring:
Change theme to dark
Make tabs maximize instead of what they do now when you put them at the top of the screen


# Apps I need to install:

ALVR


Done:
